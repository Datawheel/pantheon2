      <h1>The Pantheon Team</h1>
      <p>Pantheon is a project from the <a href="http://macroconnections.media.mit.edu/">Macro Connections</a> group at The MIT Media Lab. We are a team of designers, engineers, and scientists working collaboratively to quantify, analyze, measure and visualize global culture.</p>
      <p>Macro Connections is a research group at the MIT Media Lab focused on studying collective learning—the process by which groups of people create ideas and technologies as a collective. We are a team of designers, engineers, and scientists that deploy our diverse set of skills to gain a better understanding of the world. Follow us on Twitter @MacroMIT!</p>
      <p>Datawheel is a small but mighty crew of programmers and designers who are here to make sense of the world’s vast amount of data. They know how to turn any client’s raw data into an interactive interface that is clear, accessible, and beautiful.</p>
      <p>Pantheon is made possible by the generous support of the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/sponsorship/sponsor-list">Media Lab Consortia</a> and the <a href="http://www.knowledgelab.org/">Metaknowledge Network</a> at the University of Chicago.</p>
