      <h1>The Pantheon Team</h1>
      <p>Pantheon is a project by the <a href="http://www.macroconnections.media.mit.edu/">Collective Learning</a> group at the MIT Media Lab. The Pantheon visualization engine is a collaboration between Collective Learning and <a href="http://www.datawheel.us">Datawheel</a>.</p>
      <p>Collective Learning is a research group at the MIT Media Lab focused on studying collective learning—the learning that happens at the group level, such as organizations, regions, countries, and the global community. We are a team of designers, engineers, and scientists that deploy our diverse set of skills to gain a better understanding of the world. Follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/macromit">@MacroMIT</a>.</p>
      <p>Datawheel is a small but mighty crew of programmers and designers who are here to make sense of the world’s vast amount of data. They know how to turn any client’s raw data into an interactive interface that is clear, accessible, and beautiful.</p>
      <p>Pantheon is made possible by the generous support of the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/sponsorship/sponsor-list">Media Lab Consortia</a> and the <a href="http://www.knowledgelab.org/">Metaknowledge Network</a> at the University of Chicago.</p>
